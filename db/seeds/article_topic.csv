Those who do not complain are never pitied.
"From politics, it was an easy step to silence."
Nobody minds having what is too good for them.
Be happy for this moment. This moment is your life.
"We know what we are, but know not what we may be."
"We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope."
The only thing worse than being blind is having sight but no vision.
"Yesterday is not ours to recover, but tomorrow is ours to win or lose."
There is not one in a hundred of either sex who is not taken in when they marry.
"There is safety in reserve, but no attraction. One cannot love a reserved person."
"In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show more affection than she feels."
They are much to be pitied who have not been given a taste for nature early in life.
"For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbors and laugh at them in our turn?"
It is always incomprehensible to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage.
"Surprises are foolish things. The pleasure is not enhanced, and the inconvenience is often considerable."
"A woman, especially, if she have the misfortune of knowing anything, should conceal it as well as she can."
"There are certainly not so many men of large fortune in the world, as there are pretty women to deserve them."
Single women have a dreadful propensity for being poor. Which is one very strong argument in favor of matrimony.
"It will, I believe, be everywhere found, that as the clergy are, or are not what they ought to be, so are the rest of the nation."
No man is offended by another man's admiration of the woman he loves; it is the woman only who can make it a torment.
"Nothing is more deceitful than the appearance of humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast."
"Good-humoured, unaffected girls, will not do for a man who has been used to sensible women. They are two distinct orders of being."
"There is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind, that one is sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions."
"My idea of good company is the company of clever, well-informed people who have a great deal of conversation; that is what I call good company."
"Seldom, very seldom, does complete truth belong to any human disclosure; seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised, or a little mistaken."
"Give a girl an education and introduce her properly into the world, and ten to one but she has the means of settling well, without further expense to anybody."
"The power of doing anything with quickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance."
Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story. Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree; the pen has been in their hands. I will not allow books to prove anything.
"It is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are they the result of previous study?"
"Woman is fine for her own satisfaction alone. No man will admire her the more, no woman will like her the better for it. Neatness and fashion are enough for the former, and a something of shabbiness or impropriety will be most endearing to the latter."
