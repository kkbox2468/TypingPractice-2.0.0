"To iterate is human, to recurse divine."
"First, solve the problem. Then, write the code."
Nobody minds having what is too good for them.
Be happy for this moment. This moment is your life.
"Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it's bad."
"We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope."
The only thing worse than being blind is having sight but no vision.
"A conscious human is driven by their conscience, not popular opinion."
 I'm not a great programmer. I'm just a good programmer with great habits.
"The best thing about a boolean is even if you are wrong, you are only off by a bit."
They are much to be pitied who have not been given a taste for nature early in life.
The most disastrous thing that you can ever learn is your first programming language.
You shouldn't do things differently just because they're different. They need to be better.
"Sometimes it's better to leave something alone, to pause, and that's very true of programming."
"Everybody in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you how to think."
"Surprises are foolish things. The pleasure is not enhanced, and the inconvenience is often considerable."
"I learned the fundamentals for programming, which is just what I needed as a first step for my career change!"
"The craft of programming begins with empathy, not formatting or languages or tools or algorithms or data structures."
Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.
In carpentry you measure twice and cut once. In software development you never measure and make cuts until you run out of time.
"Nothing is more deceitful than the appearance of humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast."
"Programs, like people, get old. We can't prevent ageing, but we can understand its causes, limit its effects and reverse some of the damage."
Big Brother fills us all with the same crap. My guess is he was clever the same way everybody thinks they're clever. I tell her to type in 'password'.
"My idea of good company is the company of clever, well-informed people who have a great deal of conversation; that is what I call good company."
"Learning to write programs stretches your mind, and helps you think better, creates a way of thinking about things that I think is helpful in all domains."
"The power of doing anything with quickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance."
"Do not use humans for jobs computers can do better — this is a waste of human energy and creativity, the only real resource on this planet, and demeans the human spirit."
"Coding is the language of the future, and every girl should learn it. As I've learned from watching girls grow and learn in our classrooms, coding is fun, collaborative and creative."
"Data dominates. If you've chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming."
Remember that code is really the language in which we ultimately express the requirements. We may create languages that are closer to the requirements. We may create tools that help us parse and assemble those requirements into formal structures. But we will never eliminate necessary precision—so there will always be code.
