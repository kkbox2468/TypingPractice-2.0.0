"Amazon has opened its first automated store to the public. Amazon Go is a grocery store located on the ground level of the corporation's Seattle headquarters. The store, which offers food, salads and boxed meals could revolutionize our shopping experience in the future. As soon as you arrive at the store, a cell phone app connected to an Amazon account registers your presence. Everything that happens in the store is tracked by hundreds of infrared cameras. When you pick up items from the shelves they are automatically put into your virtual shopping cart. The cameras also detect when you put an item back on the shelves and remove it from your cart. The moment you walk out your account is charged without making any physical payment. The technologies used at Amazon Go are the same as with driverless cars -  computer tracking, weight sensors on shelves and complicated algorithms. The 1,800 square foot store has been open to Amazon employees for a year. Now the public can also shop there. However, not everything has been running smoothly in the store's opening year.There were hardships to overcome. For example, it's hard for cameras to distinguish between different flavours or products that look the same. They also have problems handling people who move around or identifying shoppers with similar body sizes and clothes. Even though there are no checkout counters and cashiers who make you wait in line, there are shop assistants who restock goods and help customers find their way around."
"NASA has discovered the eighth planet of a star system, similar to our solar system. The star, Kepler-90  is over 2,500 light years away and larger and hotter than our sun. It is the first star known to have as many planets as our solar system. The Kepler-90 star system is much more compact than our solar system. The outermost planet orbits the star at about the same distance as the earth orbits the sun.  its inner planets are small and rocky while the outer ones are larger and made up of gas. The newly discovered planet, Kepler -90i, is the third celestial object in the star system. It is probably rocky and similar to our earth, but because of its closeness to its home star has an average surface temperature of about 400¢X C. It moves around the star once every 14.4 days. The discovery was made based on data provided by the Kepler space telescope. Launched in March 2009, the telescope has constantly been scanning certain sections of the universe in search of new stars and planetary systems. Up to now, over 2,000 new worlds have been discovered. To help analyse the data NASA has been relying on artificial intelligence software supplied by Google.  This software examines weak signals of light when objects pass in front of a star.  The new way of examining data is expected to reveal even more new planets in the future."
"The World Health Organisation has added the term ""gaming disorder"" to its International Classification of Diseases. It refers to people who are addicted to video and other games and cannot stop. It is the first update in the WHO's catalogue in almost three decades. According to the WHO, gaming becomes a disorder if you are unable to control how long you play and when to stop. When that happens, it gets control of your life, influences everyday situations and affects your daily routine. WHO officials say that excessive gaming is  a serious disorder that must be closely watched. In order for a person to be regarded as having a gaming disorder, the behaviour must be going on for at least one year, either constantly or in phases. Gamers put their addiction above their family life, meeting with friends and going to school. On one side studies have shown that playing video games may help with problems like depression and dementia. However, gaming is highly addictive and many people play for a longer time than is healthy. As a result, people get fired for not going to work or miss school classes for a longer period of time. Many continue with their addiction, even if they see and realize the negative consequences it leads to."
"According to a new publication by American neurologists, regular exercise can improve your memory and thinking skills. We know that exercise has proven to be good for your heart and overall fitness, but now doctors say that it can actually help you remember things. As we get older most of us have problems  with memory, language  and thinking about certain things. This is called mild cognitive impairment (MCI) .In most cases, such problems don't influence our everyday life but we realize them. Exercising may slow down the rate of MCI and reduce the risk of getting dementia at a later phase in life. Unlike people with dementia, those with mild cognitive impairment can cope with their regular routine, like getting dressed or preparing meals. However, they may have trouble remembering dates, appointments and where they left their keys.  This may be the first step to Alzheimer's disease or dementia. While there is no medicine and dietary way to fight against memory loss, neurologists encourage people to do some form of aerobic exercise, like walking, running or cycling or swimming for a total of 2 .5 hours a week. They recommend exercising just so fast that you don't sweat and can talk to others. More than 6% of all people around the world have a mild form of cognitive impairment. As people get older the rate increases and jumps to 37% of all over 85 year-olds ."
"SpaceX, a private space transport company owned by American billionaire Elon Musk, has launched the world's most powerful rocket, the Falcon Heavy. It is the larger version of the Falcon 9 rocket, which has successfully been putting payloads into space for years. The booster is made up of three rockets strapped together for combined thrust.The Falcon Heavy was developed over a period of 7 years and cost about $500 million. It is 23 stories tall and has 27 engines. The rocket's thrust equals that of 18 Boeing 747 jumbo jets.The new rocket is designed to send large satellites into earth orbit. It can carry 64 metric tons, twice the payload of other rockets, into space at a lower price. The rocket can also transport spacecraft to destinations further away from earth. In addition, its starting boosters are reusable.The first flight was set to travel as far as the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The rocket had an electric sports car, Elon Musk's privateTesla Roadster, on board.SpaceX has been flying NASA cargo missions to the International Space Station for a few years. The company wants to compete with other business in carrying payloads to space. Musk's company has several commercial customers and has been receiving contracts to fly government payloads. The first manned mission to space is planned for the end of 2018."
"Chinese New Year is the most important holiday of the Chinese calendar. The New Year begins between January 21 and February 20. The celebration starts with the second new moon after the beginning of winter (December 21) and lasts until the next full moon. The Chinese name their years after 12 different animals: the rat, the ox, the tiger, the hare, the dragon, the snake, the horse, the sheep, the monkey, the rooster, the dog, the pig. Some people believe that a human being¡¦s personality and character depends on the animal of the year he or she was born. The Chinese New Year marks the start of the next animal¡¦s year. After the year of the pig the twelve year cycle starts over again with the year of the rat. A lot of things are done for Chinese New Year. Houses are cleaned from top to bottom in the days before the beginning of the holidays. People write merry wishes on red paper and hang them all over the house. Rooms are decorated with flowers, plants and oranges."
"A research report says that virtual worlds can be important places where children practice what they will do in real life. They are also a powerful and attractive alternative to more passive adventures like watching TV. The research was done with children using the BBC's Adventure Rock virtual world, aimed at those aged 6-12.It surveyed and interviewed children who were the first to test the game. The online world is a theme island built for the BBC's children channel by Belgian game maker Larian. Children explore the world alone but they use message boards to share what they find and what they do in the different creative studios they find around the virtual space. At times children were explorers and at others they were social climbers eager to connect with other players. Some were power users looking for more information about how the virtual space really worked. The children could try all kinds of things without having to be afraid of the consequences that would follow if they tried them in the real world. They learned many useful social skills and played around with their identity in ways that would be much more difficult in real life. According to the study what children liked about virtual worlds was the chance to create content such as music, cartoons and videos. The publishers of the report say that virtual worlds can be a powerful, engaging and real interactive alternative to more passive media. They urged creators of virtual spaces for children to get young people involved very early on because they really do have good ideas to add and they are very good critical friends."
